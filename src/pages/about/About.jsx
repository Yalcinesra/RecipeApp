          <h3>Iâ€™m currently learning Full-Stack Development Languages.</h3>
          <h4>I am a graduate of Selcuk University Computer Systems teaching and worked as an information technologies teacher for 8 years. While I was learning C++ and Java programming languages during my university education, I also learned to use important web development tools such as HTML, CSS and Photoshop. Throughout my career, I have gained various experiences in computer technologies and computing. I worked as an IT leader at Deutsches Rotes Kreuz for 6 months, during which I was responsible for managing and developing the technology infrastructure.
